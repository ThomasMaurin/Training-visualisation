# Training-visualisation
Visualisation development as part of my training
# SUMMARY

My goal is to provide a visualization showing how flight delays have evolved, based on United States department of Transportation  data which records total flights and total delays in minutes, by arrival airport and carrier. The visualization, which is my first project in HTML, relies on open source software and should be understandable by non-technical people: how are the flight delays evolving?

## Importation of data

I used the Bureau of Transportation statistics website and downloaded flights data for the last 4 years (2015-2018), for all carriers and all US airports.
I performed data exploration in R to understand the data structure. I detected an increase in flights arrival delays over the biggest airports, which is the data story I want to illustrate.
